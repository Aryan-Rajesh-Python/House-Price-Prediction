In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting house prices using features such as the number of bedrooms, location, and total square footage. I employed multiple linear regression and systematically evaluated six different machine learning models using GridSearchCV, optimizing hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy. The final model achieved an impressive accuracy of 85%, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.5 and an R-squared value of 0.92. This project provides real estate stakeholders with invaluable insights, allowing them to make informed pricing decisions that could enhance their investment strategies and revenue outcomes.
